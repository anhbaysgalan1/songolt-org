Mongolia is a land-locked country in Central Asia with a population of about 3.2 million people (2020 estimate). It is the least densely populated sovereign nation (2 per square kilometer). The primary industry is extractive (mostly coal, copper, gold, and silver), with both raw and finished cashmere following. 

About one-third of its population are still nomadic herders, residing in the traditional ger, or yurt. Ulaanbaatar, the capital city, has a population of around 1.5 million, nearly half the population of the country. The city has been plagued with high levels of air pollution in the winter months. Recent government actions may be reducing this pollution, but more time is needed to be certain.
