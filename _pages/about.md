There are many unique things about Mongolia.
- It is the least densely populated sovereign nation (2 people per km2)
- It has the coldest capital city in the world.
- It is the only country in Central Asia with a "Free" rating by [Freedom House](https://freedomhouse.org/explore-the-map?type=fiw&year=2020&country=MNG). 

As interesting as the first two points are, the last one is the most important. Mongolia's democracy is young, and its civil society is still being developed. Mongolia is a shining light of democracy in a sea of authoritarianism. **Songolt** was created to give public data, analysis, and tools to civil society organizations and the public in general. We believe that with the right data and tools the Mongolian people can defend and promote the young and vibrant democracy they have worked so hard to create.
