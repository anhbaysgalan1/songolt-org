All the work on Songolt is done on my own time. I'm committed to working on one to two posts a month, but with your support I could do even more. Hosting datasets and server costs for tools is also a significant cost over time. In addition, making great content, performing analysis, and building tools takes a significant amount of time and effort. 

Support the creation of analysis, data, and tools for Mongolian civil society by becoming a supporter on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/songolt). By becoming a supporter you will allow for the work here to continue and get access to patron benefits. Patrons get mentioned on the site as a supporter and get access to a monthly Q&A where you can ask data and data science-related questions. For those that want a say in the direction of Songolt and what gets posted, All-Access patrons also get to vote on future projects.
