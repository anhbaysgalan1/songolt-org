            "title": "Five Ways Mongolia Can Use Remote Sensing",
            "content": ". As the least densely populated soverign nation (2 inhabitants per km2), Mongolia has no lack of wide open spaces. Just a few kilometers outside the capital city, Ulaanbaatar, you will find vast expanses of steppe dotted with sheep, goats, cows, and the occasional horse herd. But this space also has a downside. . Simply put, driving around Mongolia is hard. Mongolia&#39;s paved road network is mostly limited to connecting Ulaanbaatar with provincial capitals. Less than 25% of Mongolia&#39;s road network is paved. This creates challenges for Mongolia&#39;s government, civil society organizations, and private businesses. Obtaining accurate information about activities outside the capital or province capitals is very hard to obtain. Remote sensing techniques are one way to mitigate this challenge. . Remote sensing, or the the process of detecting physical characteristics of an area by measuring reflected radiation, can obtain accurate information for a relatively low cost. Remote sensing can take the form of satellite images that look much like a Google Maps image, but images can also contain a lot of information in the non-visible spectrum that can be analyzed for various purposes. In addition, technologies like radar and LIDAR (light detection and ranging or light + radar) add to the types of information that can be obtained by satellites. Remote sensing is also not limited to satellites. Drones can be outfitted with similar types of sensors as satellites to gather information at a much finer detail. . Remote sensing techniques can be used in one area over a period of time for a much lower cost than having a large team gather data on foot. To illustrate how this could be done in Mongolia, I will describe five ways remote sensing can be used to solve real challenges Mongolia faces. . 1. Cheaply monitor agriculture . Mongolia has a long history of producing a limited range of vegetables, wheat, and other cereal crops. However, this domestic production does not always meet domestic demand, especially for wheat. With a short growing season, unpredictable rainfall, and large swings in temperature, Mongolia&#39;s agriculture sector faces many challenges with food crops. . Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is one way to monitor crops cheaply and easily. By utilizing satellite imagery that is readily available, fields can be evaluated for the health of the crops over time. Here is an example of what an NDVI image looks like. . . In the above image you can see the darker areas of the image, which would correspond to lower biomass. The higher the value on the scale, generally the healthier the plants. Farms can use this data to target problem spots and generally understand how their fields are producing. . Accessing satellite imagery and performing a weekly NDVI analysis on every farm in Mongolia during the growing season is reasonable and cost effective. Expecting small and medium farm enterprises to accomplish this task is not though. . This type of analysis requires technical skills in both data engineering and IT infrastructure. Therefore a specialized program or office within the Ministry of Agriculture would be ideal. Given the national importance of meeting domestic demand of vegetables and cereals, it makes sense for the government to support farmers in this way. . 2. Find illegal mining or construction . Construction and mining are two areas of industry tightly regulated by the Mongolian government. Nevertheless, both illegal construction and illegal mining are considered to be relatively common. Mongolia&#39;s large size makes discovering these illegal activities very challenging. . Using satellite imagery changes in forest cover or grass areas can be detected over time. In the image below, you can see an analysis completed that identified clear cut areas in Siberia. . . Using a similar methodology, areas of illegal construction or mining could be discovered. One limitation is that these areas would need to be sufficiently large to be detected. This means small illegal mining operations or individual buildings may not be detected unless sufficiently high resolution imagery becomes available. . If this change detection is combined with cadastral maps, construction permits, and mining permits, areas of illegal change could be more easily discovered. . 3. Learn where nomads live and how they move . Nearly 20% of Mongolia&#39;s households are nomadic herders. They have no addresses and they move several times a year. Since 1990 the number of animals these households herd has skyrocketed. In 2020 there are over 70 million herd animals, up from 20 million prior to 1990. . Here is an image from Google Earth showing a cluster of three gers in Zavkhan Aimag. . . By collecting and labeling enough images such as this one, and object detection model could be made to identify these gers around Mongolia. This would provide local governments, civil society organizations, and researchers to better understand how Mongolia&#39;s vast lands are being used to support the ever increasing number of herd animals. . Plus, a &quot;ger detector&quot; sounds pretty cool right? . 4. Monitor government construction projects . The summer season in Mongolia is really the only time construction projects can move forward. Consequently , the government has many construction projects occurring around the country at the same time. A few current projects include the New Darkhan Road, Tavan Tolgoi railway project, and the Maidar City project. . The Tavan Tolgoi railway project will reduce the cost to deliver coal to China significantly, increasing government revenues and potentially increasing the ability to export coal. The project was originally announced in 2012, received 280 million USD in funds from the Chinggis Bond in 2013, and has since been stalled. Construction of the base of the railway was said to be completed, but without an official audit little is known about the current state of construction. Satellite imagery could be used to give a low cost initial assessment without the significant cost of an in person audit. . In another situation, Dr. Julian Dierkes, a sociologist and keen Mongolian observer, asked the following question on Twitter. . Apparently, B. Munkhbaatar, new Min Construction &amp; Urban Development, visited Maidar development project. Would love to see current state of construction, rather than photo of plans (👇 New Zuunmod plan) https://t.co/7Gsgw4whjl . &mdash; Julian Dierkes (@jdierkes) July 27, 2020 . The new Minister of Construction and Urban Development visited the Maidar City project. This project is designed to create a satellite city away from Ulaanbaatar to decentralize urban development in Mongolia. The image and text from Monstsame, the government run news agency, made the project appear to be progressing. . I replied to Dr. Dierkes tweet with the following screenshot taken from Planet Labs Explorer. This satellite image was taken just 7 days prior to the Ministers visit. . . This image is nearly identical to the status of the construction site last year. . Basically same state that it was all in last year then? pic.twitter.com/LExvetxAbK . &mdash; Julian Dierkes (@jdierkes) July 28, 2020 . 5. Flood risk survey . Every year summer brings rain to Mongolia, sometimes in large amounts that creates flooding around the country. In July 2020 8 people died and 2,300 homes were damaged. . By using remote sensing techniques a flood risk assessment could be created for the entire country or selected areas. Here is a flood hazard index map created for selected communities in Ghana, Burkina Faso and Benin. The government, insurance companies, and individuals could use these maps to plan ahead and hopefully prevent loss of life and property. . . Thanks for reading . Thank you for reading Songolt.org.

            "title": "Executive Summary - Assessing COVID-19 Risk in Mongolia",
            "content": ". Note: This is the executive summary. To view the full article, Assessing COVID-19 Risk in Mongolia, please click here. . Mongolia is a unique case with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As of the writing of this article, there is no community transmission of the virus. All cases currently in the country are in quarantine. Primarily because of the success Mongolia has had in preventing community transmission, many outside the country are pointing to the Mongolian example as something to learn from. . Since March 2020, every person entering the country has been required to submit to 21 days of quarantine. During this time they are tested multiple times for COVID-19. Testing in the general community is also performed if a person presents flu like symptoms at a local hospital. In addition, random sampling is performed. . Even with all of these precautionary measures in place, there is still significant fear in the general population With these precautionary measures in place, the goal of this article is to determine the answer to one question: . What is the likelihood of a single undiscovered COVID-19 case in the community? . Using currently known information and statistical simulation, several scenarios are evaluated:- Could an infectious person in quarantine be missed by testing and released into the public?- What if an infected person escaped from quarantine and an outbreak happened in Ulaanbaatar? Is it possible that this outbreak is missed? . Evaluate the possibility that COVID-19 has been in Mongolia since before March and was somehow missed. | An infected animal infects nomads in an aimag center or a rural area. | . Can an infection in quarantine be missed? . As of July 28, 2020, Mongolia has had a total of 289 cases of COVID-19. Using a stochastic modeling process, it was determined the probability that a single infectious person in quarantine could be missed by two tests is 2.8%. While not zero, this is a very small probability. Planning and preparation are probably the most reasonable responses, not fear. . . What if an infected person escaped from quarantine? . Assuming an infected person escaped from quarantine, a SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model was created to determine the potential spread of the virus in Mongolia. Assuming an R0 of 2, there would be an estimated 148 infections after 20 days. Globally an estimated 80% of cases are mild or asymptomatic, which leaves 20% (29 of the 148) with enough symptoms to present at a hospital. Each of these symptomatic cases would be tested for COVID-19. With a false negative rate of 1%, the probability that each of these cases would be missed was determined to be 1.00x10-58. This is roughly equivalent to the probability of being struck by lightning tens times in a given year. . The virus has been in the community since before the quarantine started. . Using the model from the previous scenario, it was determined that any time period 20 days prior to today is essentially guaranteed to not have had infections. Given the highly contagious nature of COVID-19, any outbreak would be quickly discovered with the current testing regime. . To evaluate if there were undiscovered infections death statistics were collected from the National Statistics Office. By comparing the historic monthly average number of deaths compared to the actual numbers for January to June of 2020, we can see if there was &quot;excess mortality&quot;. However, no excess mortality was seen. . . An infected animal infects nomads in an aimag center or a rural area. . However unrealistic this scenario, this possibility was nevertheless published on some Mongolian websites. Two situations were modeled to determine the reality of this risk: . The herder decides to go to the Aimag center while he is infectious. | The herder doesn&#39;t go anywhere, and only sees 2 people outside his immediate family each week. | . In the first, the same SIR model was used, but with a lower population of 12,000. The same methodology was used to measure the probability that this outbreak could be missed. After 20 days an estimated 141 people would be infected. 28 (20% of 141 people) would be symptomatic. The probability that each of these symptomatic positive cases would have a false negative test are 1.00x10-56. This is an incredibly small probability. . In the second situation another SIR model was created using an R0 of 1.2. In a rural area with such low contact between families the infection would most likely not spread past the immediate family. The SIR model estimated that only 2 people would be infected and then the infection would die out. . Conclusion . My goal for this analysis is not to say that the risk of COVID-19 in Mongolia is over. On the contrary, there are still infections being announced each week of those in quarantine arriving from abroad. In addition, some countries still have major challenges in curbing rising infections. . Instead, my goal was to assess the risk of community transmission over the past several months given what we know about quarantine and testing procedures in Mongolia. While this analysis is far from a comprehensive assessment of risk for the entire country, it does answer some of the most common questions I&#39;ve heard from Mongolians worried about COVID-19. A few examples: . All it takes is one infected person to cause a disaster. We have found that if one infected person was actually in public, we would almost surely have found out by now. | . | How do we know someone can&#39;t just sneak out of quarantine? If someone did sneak out of quarantine, we would very shortly see several people with symptoms at hospitals. These cases would very quickly discovered and contact tracing would rapidly occur. Just remember the figures, these cases would be quickly discovered. | . | Can you really trust that the government is doing its job? With regards to the quarantine, I believe the evidence I have given supports that the government is in fact doing its job. For other areas, I would defer to journalists. It is in their area of responsibility to question the government and inform the Mongolian people in this respect. | . | Better safe than sorry. There is risk in nearly anything we do. I&#39;ve shown that you are more likely to be struck by lightning several times in one year than for a cluster of COVID-19 infections to be missed. If this incredibly small risk is causing you to change your behavior, then you also may want to rethink walking outside in the rain. | . | . My hope is that this work and the work of others can start a discussion of how best to move forward given the times we are in. Staying closed off indefinitely is most surely a plan that will have very serious consequences. Yet exactly how restrictions should be relaxed and things reopened is a larger discussion for the Mongolian people and the government. . About the Author .

Framing the Risk Assessment . Mongolia is a unique case with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As of the writing of this article, there is no community transmission of the virus. All cases currently in the country are in quarantine. Primarily because of the success Mongolia has had in preventing community transmission, many outside the country are pointing to the Mongolian example as something to learn from. . Here is a timeline of events since January. The first part of the table is summarized from an article from The Lancet 1. Events from April 15th onward were compiled from local news reports. . Dates Actions taken by the Mongolian Government . January 6-12, 2020 | First public precautions introduced by the Ministry of Health | . January 20-26, 2020 | Educational institutions at all levels are temporarily closed until March 30, 2020 (later extended to September 1); travel restrictions applied to China | . January 27-February 2, 2020 | Incoming travelers from countries with COVID-19 cases must go through a period of quarantine. Tsagaan Sar restrictions put in place. | . February 10-16, 2020 | Quarantine camps are prepared. | . February 17-23, 2020 | Disinfection protocols for port trucks and trains are created. Domestic travel ban applied for Tsagaan Sar (Feb 23-27). This ban is later extended until March 3. | . March 9, 2020 | First confirmed case detected on foreign national who recently entered country. All businesses except grocery stores closed until March 16. Another domestic travel ban put in place. All international travel banned on March 10. | . April 15, 2020 | Resorts are allowed to reopen and are expected to clean and sanitize regularly. | . April 30, 2020 | Bars and nightclubs allowed to reopen with requirement of 1-1.5 meter distance between patrons. Several establishments violate rules and city mayor shuts down bars and nightclubs again on May 4. | . May 1, 2020 | Cultural and sports centers reopened. | . May 4, 2020 | Training centers allowed to reopen with social distancing and capacity restrictions. | . June 22, 2020 | Libraries and museums reopen. | . July 1, 2020 | State Emergency Commission allows nearly all businesses (except schools and universities) to reopen with certain restrictions. | . July 29, 2020 | State Emergency Commission allows schools and universities to reopen on September 1. Cabinet amends the decision to have 3 days in class and 2 online. Universities will be allowed to open October 5. | . Much of the success of the government has been attributed to the quick shutdown of international travel and broad restrictions domestically. Beginning with the international travel ban on March 10, the government has been attempting to repatriate thousands of Mongolian citizens who were abroad when the ban was in place. As a result the large majority of those in quarantine are Mongolians. Recently it was disclosed that a limited number of foreign workers are being allowed in to work on economically vital projects in the country including the Oyu Tolgoi underground expansion and infrastructure projects. . The recent Naadam holiday saw huge amounts of domestic travel with little worry of coronavirus. While the national Naadam celebration was televised to prevent large crowds, local Naadam celebrations in the countryside saw medium sized gatherings of 100+. Yet the idea of risk remains in peoples minds. The recent decision by the government to have class only 3 days a week is an indicator of this. . The problem with the current concept of &quot;risk&quot; in the public is that it is not quantified and not based on facts. My aim for this analysis is to quantify the current risk of COVID-19 in Mongolia by using currently known facts. To do this I will answer a question that frames the issue of COVID-19 risk in a simpler way: . What is the likelihood of a single undiscovered COVID-19 case in the community? . This is a question that, with some assumptions, we can get a concrete answer for. It isn&#39;t the only way to frame this problem, and certainly not the most comprehensive. However, it does give a single answer that can be used to launch into a larger discussion of risk, restrictions on businesses and education, and even international travel restrictions. . To begin we first must declare the list of key terms and assumptions I will use going forward. Then we will assess the risk of a single undiscovered COVID-19 case with two methods:- Determining the likelihood that a person infected with COVID-19 would remain undetected, and then go into the general population while still infectious.- Analyze several &quot;What-if?&quot; scenarios to determine if they could have already happened without the government or public being aware. . Assumptions . To create our models we must first create some assumptions. Each are taken from research and reflect realistic values for the current situation. . Asymptomatic rate is 80%. This is based on WHO guidelines that 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic 2. This is most likely higher than reality, but nevertheless is the best number we have to work with. Other studies have shown anywhere from a 30%-50% asymptomatic rate 3. | False negative rate is 1%. This means that for every 10 people tested that have COVID-19, 1 person will receive a negative test. Mongolia uses a one-step RT-PCR test looking N and ORF1B genes 1. A recent study has shown that this type of test is nearly 100% sensitive (100 - sensitivity % = false negative %) 4. To be conservative I have made this 1%. | False positives are not considered. As there have been no positive tests indicating community transmission in Mongolia, there is no need to assess false positives. | 8,000 people have been through quarantine in Mongolia. According to a recent Lancet article 1, more than 8,000 people have been through quarantine since quarantines started in March 2020. | Multiple tests are performed on quarantined travelers. The same Lancet article stated that those in quarantine are tested periodically throughout their time in quarantine. We will assume at least two tests during the three week period. | Those with symptoms are tested. If a person presents with influenza like symptoms they are referred for testing 1. In addition, there is random sampling of the general population. | . Now that we have established our key terms and assumptions, we can move on to modeling. . Can an Infection in Quarantine be Missed? . We know that as much as 80% of COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic or mild (perhaps mild enough to not seek medical help). However, we also know that those in quarantine are tested periodically. In our assumptions we stated that each individual would be tested at least 2 times. Let&#39;s see if it is possible that someone infected would be able to leave quarantine without having a positive test. . To determine this we will use the false negative rate of the test. A false negative would occur when someone actually has an active COVID-19 infection, but the test administered returns a negative result. The type of test being used in Mongolia (the RT-PCR test) is one of the most sensitive tests possible, and is widely used and understood to give accurate results. A recent survey of this type of test from various vendors found that the sensitivity of the test is nearly 100% 4. Here is a table from Parikh et al. 5 showing the relationship between false negatives and sensitivity. . . As an example, if 100 people known to have a disease are tested and 75 people test positive and 25 people test negative, then the sensitivity of the test is 75%. . $$ (75+25) = 0.75 or 75 % $$ . To determine the false negative rate we can subtract the true positives from the total, then divide by the total. . $$ (100 - 75) / 100 = 0.025 or 25 % $$ . Even though the tests used for COVID-19 in Mongolia are basically 100% sensitive, we can assume a 99% sensitivity for this example to account for possible errors in testing. This would mean there may be a false negative rate of 1%. Now we can determine the probability that an infection is missed during two consecutive tests by multiplying the probabilities together. . 0.01 * 0.01 . 0.0001 . That is 0.0001 or 0.01%. By having two tests the probability of a missed infection is reduced by 99%. If there are three tests we can multiple the individual probabilities together. . 0.01 * 0.01 * 0.01 . 1.0000000000000002e-06 . That is 1.0000000000000002x10-6, or 0.0001%. By adding one more test we reduce the the probability of a missed infection by 99.99%. . Now we can simulate the probability that a person was able to leave quarantine without being detected. This can be done by simulating Bernoulli trials. Bernoulli trials are a random experiment where there are two possible outcomes, 0 and 1 (failure or success). In our case a &quot;success&quot; is actually a bad thing, someone infected not being detected. . Here is a function written in Python to perform Bernoulli trials. . def perform_bernoulli_trials(n, p): &quot;&quot;&quot;Perform n Bernoulli trials with success probability p and return number of successes.&quot;&quot;&quot; # Initialize number of successes: n_success n_success = 0 # Perform trials for i in range(n): # Choose random number between zero and one: random_number random_number = np.random.random() # If less than p, it&#39;s a success so add one to n_success if random_number &lt; p: n_success += 1 return n_success . Let&#39;s run this function with 1,000 known positive cases and a probability &quot;success&quot; of 0.01%. Essentially we will be flipping a coin 1,000 times with a probability of &quot;success&quot; being 0.01%. Because there is randomness in the function, you will most likely get a different answer each time the function is run. . # Simulate 1,000 cases with a probability of missing a case being 0.01% perform_bernoulli_trials(1000, 0.0001) . 0 . Our result is 0. You are almost guaranteed to get a 0 every time you run this. It is important to remember that this model is stochastic. This means that the model has randomness built in, and that each time you run it your answer is not guaranteed. Instead you can look at the distribution of many runs of the model to understand all possible outcomes and then measure the frequency of those outcomes to determine probability. If this is a confusing mess of words for you, then keep going as I will demonstrate this process and it will hopefully become more clear. . Previously we simulated 1,000 positive cases, but it turns out we don&#39;t have 1,000 positive cases. As of July 28, 2020, there were 289 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Mongolia 6. So, to be conservative, let&#39;s simulate 300 cases of COVID-19 going through quarantine and being tested two times. We will run the simulation 10,000 times. This will give us a distribution of possible outcomes that we can use to calculate a probability that 1 or more people would be able to leave quarantine and receive a false negative test twice. . # Set a random number seed so the code is reproducible. np.random.seed(42) # Create an empty list of missed infections that will be filled with our simulation next. n_missed_infections = np.empty(10000) # Simulate 300 positive cases going through quarantine 10,000 times with a probability of missing a case being 0.01%. for i in range(10000): n_missed_infections[i] = perform_bernoulli_trials(300, 0.0001) . #collapse-hide # Plot Code fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(16,9)) ax.hist(n_missed_infections, bins=[0,1,2,3], rwidth=0.5, align=&#39;left&#39;, density=True) ax.set_yticks([0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8, 0.9]) ax.set_xlabel(&#39;Number of missed infections per 300 positive cases, simulated 10,000 times&#39;, fontsize=20) ax.set_ylabel(&#39;Probability&#39;, fontsize=20) ax.set_title(&#39;Distribution of Possible Outcomes&#39;, fontsize=26); . . We can directly calculate the probability of a missed infection with the assumptions above by counting the number of simulations resulting in greater than or equal to 1 divided by the total number of simulations. . np.sum(n_missed_infections &gt;= 1) / len(n_missed_infections) . 0.0288 . This means that given 300 known positive cases there is a 2.8% chance that two consecutive COVID-19 tests would return a false negative and one case would not be detected. That means we have a 97.2% likelihood that all COVID-19 cases were caught in quarantine. . So what does this number really mean? More skeptical readers may think, so you mean there&#39;s a chance? . . Yes, there is a non-zero chance that a person may have been missed. Converted to odds, 2.8% is roughly 1 in 34 chance. Focusing on that 2.8% will probably create more irrational fear than create motivation for preparation. Let&#39;s put things in perspective. Consider a serious flood that has an average probability of occurring once over the next 34 years. How important is it to act now to ensure this possible flood does not destroy homes, roads, or other critical infrastructure? Planning and preparation are probably the most reasonable responses, not fear. . What-if? . 2.8% is not our final answer. We have to take it one step further by looking at what would happen in an infectious person was in public. Since early March all international travel has been banned, but there has been movement across the border. There is some risk in this movement, like with nearly everything in life, so let&#39;s quantify it so we can better understand whether we need to worry or not. We will look at three different scenarios and assess the probability of undiscovered infections in each. . What if an infected person escaped from quarantine? | COVID-19 has been inside Mongolia since before the travel ban. | An infected bird flies in from China and infects a rural community. . Note: Scenario three is decidedly not realistic. Some websites reported that this is possible, which was then fact-checked and found to not have merit. Let&#8217;s consider it anyways as it is a useful thing to look at potential spread in rural communities. | Scenario 1 - What if an infected person escaped from quarantine? . Now that we know the risk of missing an infection, let&#39;s take things a step further and simulate what might happen if a single infectious case actually did go into the community. To do this we will use a model type called SIR (susceptible, infected, recovered) that is common in projecting infectious disease spread. It models the spread of a virus in a closed population assuming that everyone in the population is susceptible to the disease. While it isn&#39;t the most complex or even accurate model, it is useful in quickly creating projections of infectious disease spread in a population. . Important: The goal of this is not to project what might happen in the future, but to assume that it already happened and that the cases were not discovered. Our goal will be to use the infection numbers from the SIR model to evaluate the probability that the spread COVID-19 could remain undetected in the population. As Ulaanbaatar is the main population center of Mongolia, we will model the spread of COVID-19 there. We will use code adapted from Learning Scientific Programming with Python book and Jonathan Soma&#39;s Python Disease Modeling Repository 7 8. . First we will define the function that will calculate the differential equation of the SIR model. . # The SIR model differential equations. def deriv(state, t, N, beta, gamma): S, I, R = state # Change in S population over time dSdt = -beta * S * I / N # Change in I population over time dIdt = beta * S * I / N - gamma * I # Change in R population over time dRdt = gamma * I return dSdt, dIdt, dRdt . Let&#39;s define some key variables we will use to build our SIR model: . R0. Also called the basic reproduction number. It is the number of people a single person is expected to infect. This number does by itself consider time, so should not be considered a rate. This number is probably the most important number when modeling COVID-19. Social distancing measures are designed to reduce this number in order to flatten the curve in an epidemic. | The WHO estimates that the R0 for COVID-19 is between 2 and 4 9. | . | Effective contact rate. This is the chance that an infectious person will transmit a disease to a susceptible person they come in contact with. | Recovery rate. The average number of days an infected person could pass on the disease. Expressed as 1/γ = n days. . Note: By dividing the effective contact rate by the recovery rate, we can get the R0 value. We will use the following parameters in order to arrive at a R0 value of 2. This is on the lower end of the scale as assessed by the World Health Organization 9. . | Effective contact rate = 0.5 - This means that an infected person has a 50% chance of transmitting the disease to a susceptible person. . | Recovery rate = 4 days - This does not mean that a person is cured in 4 days. It simply means that after 4 days a person, on average, would not be infecting because they would be aware of the infection or for other reasons. | R0 = 2 - By taking 0.5 / (1/4) we arrive at an R0 of 2. | Population = 1.5 million - This is roughly the population of Ulaanbaatar. We will model the population of Ulaanbaatar because it is where half the population of the city lies and is the major urban area of the country. | Time period = 120 days - A time period of 120 days was chosen as it is sufficient time to see the rise and fall of infection numbers. | . effective_contact_rate = 0.5 recovery_rate = 1/4 # Everyone not infected or recovered is susceptible total_pop = 1500000 recovered = 0 infected = 1 susceptible = total_pop - infected - recovered # A list of days, 0-120 days = list(range(0, 120)) # We can calculate the R0 by dividing the effective contact rate by the recovery rate. print(&quot;R0 is&quot;, effective_contact_rate / recovery_rate) . R0 is 2.0 . Now we can integrate the differential equations to calculate the number of infections from day 0 to 120 based on our variables defined above. . # Use Scipy&#39;s differential equation method ret = odeint(deriv, [susceptible, infected, recovered], days, args=(total_pop, effective_contact_rate, recovery_rate)) S, I, R = ret.T # Build a dataframe of S, I, and R df = pd.DataFrame({ &#39;suseptible&#39;: S, &#39;infected&#39;: I, &#39;recovered&#39;: R, &#39;day&#39;: days }) # Look at days 0-10 df.head(11) . suseptible infected recovered day . 0 1499999.00000 | 1.00000 | 0.00000 | 0 | . 1 1499998.43195 | 1.28402 | 0.28403 | 1 | . 2 1499997.70256 | 1.64872 | 0.64872 | 2 | . 3 1499996.76601 | 2.11700 | 1.11700 | 3 | . 4 1499995.56345 | 2.71827 | 1.71828 | 4 | . 5 1499994.01934 | 3.49033 | 2.49034 | 5 | . 6 1499992.03667 | 4.48166 | 3.48168 | 6 | . 7 1499989.49088 | 5.75454 | 4.75458 | 7 | . 8 1499986.22204 | 7.38895 | 6.38901 | 8 | . 9 1499982.02479 | 9.48755 | 8.48766 | 9 | . 10 1499976.63548 | 12.18217 | 11.18235 | 10 | . We can see that after 10 days 1 infection will turn into more than 12 infections. Viruses spread in an exponential manner, so the the number of infections will rise rapidly. We can visualize the full time period from day 0 to 120 with the plot below. . #collapse-hide fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(16,9)) ax.plot(df[&#39;day&#39;], df[&#39;infected&#39;]) ax.set_xlabel(&#39;Days&#39;, fontsize=20) ax.set_ylabel(&#39;Number Infected&#39;, fontsize=20) ax.set_title(&#39;SIR Model of COVID-19 Spread&#39;, fontsize=26); . . In this model, the peak of the number of infections is at day 56 with 229,887 infections. This shows the potential danger of even one person infected with COVID-19 being in the community. . While this is only a simulation of what could happen, it is already very hard to believe that 229,887 infections in the public of Mongolia could be somehow missed by random testing and hospitals. Even with an asymptomatic rate of 80%, that still leaves 20% which would have severe enough symptoms to warrant a hospital visit (around 45,977 people). . Let&#39;s look at a short time period though. If an infected person has only been in the community for 20 days, how many infections might there be? . #collapse-hide df[df[&#39;day&#39;] == 20] . . suseptible infected recovered day . 20 1499704.25917 | 148.35584 | 147.38499 | 20 | . At day 20 there would already be 148 infections. How many of those would be asymptomatic and how many would show symptoms? . print(&quot;Asymptomatic cases: &quot;, 148 * .80) print(&quot;Sympomatic cases: &quot;, 148 * .20) . Asymptomatic cases: 118.4 Sympomatic cases: 29.6 . So we would have 29 symptomatic cases. Given the existing procedure of testing symptomatic cases presented at hospitals, only one positive test of someone outside quarantine would be needed to at least hint at community transmission of COVID-19 in Mongolia. So far there has not been a single positive test of anyone outside a controlled environment, so this situation would seem to be highly unlikely. . In order to ensure our logic is right, we can determine the probability that all 29 symptomatic cases would return a false negative. To calculate the probability of N false negatives, we can take the probability of a single false negative and raise it to the Nth power. . # A double asterisk is used to create exponents in Python 0.01 ** 29 . 1.0000000000000006e-58 . In this case the probability of 29 false negatives is extremely small. So small it is essentially impossible. To give some perspective, I wanted to compare this probability to something very unlikely, being struck by lightning. . I found that the odds of being struck by lightning in a given year are 1 in 1.222 million. Converting to probability we get 6.69x10-13. This is still a long way away from 1.00x10-58. Let&#39;s calculate a roughly equivalent probability of lightning strikes. . # Odds of being struck by lightning are 1 in 1.222 million. Source: https://www.weather.gov/safety/lightning-odds lightning_strike_odds = 1 / 1222000 # We can convert the odds to probability by dividing by one plus the odds. lightning_strike_prob = lightning_strike_odds / (1 + lightning_strike_odds) print(&quot;Probability of being struck by lightning in a given year: &quot;, lightning_strike_prob) print(&quot;Probability of being struck by lightning TWICE in a given year: &quot;, lightning_strike_prob**2) print(&quot;Probability of being struck by lightning TEN TIMES in a given year: &quot;, lightning_strike_prob**10) . Probability of being struck by lightning in a given year: 8.183299359002163e-07 Probability of being struck by lightning TWICE in a given year: 6.696638839904521e-13 Probability of being struck by lightning TEN TIMES in a given year: 1.3467419459456997e-61 . The probability of being struck by lightning twice in a given year is still less at 5.28x10-19. This is still a significantly higher probability than 1.00x10-58. It turns out that it would take 10 lightning strikes in a given year to have a roughly equal probability to having 29 false negatives. . So, if a single infected individual was somehow in the population, and they were able to avoid being detected for 20 days, there is basically a 0% probability that they and those they infected would not be discovered. Converted to odds, 0.01^29 is 1 in ten octodecillion. That&#39;s 57 zeros behind the 1. . Scenario 2 - The virus has been in the community since before quarantine started. . The very first infection recorded in Mongolia was from a French citizen who came to Mongolia for work. They ignored requirements to self-quarantine and came into contact with more than 100 individuals. Luckily no one else was infected, and the person was isolated. This brings up a fear that perhaps COVID-19 has been in Mongolia since January. . In Scenario 1, we already determined that the probability of a missed large scale infection is essentially 0% 20 days after the introduction of a single infectious individual. We can restate this differently by saying that any supposed community infections more than 20 days in the past is essentially irrelevant. The likelihood that they occurred or were any danger to the larger population is 0%. . If this doesn&#39;t convince you, let&#39;s look at a method developed to discover undetected COVID-19 cases in populations where there is insufficient testing. Called excess mortality, it has become an excellent method to determine more realistic numbers of COVID-19 deaths in countries or areas where there is less testing or delayed official infection numbers 10. . We can create our own calculated of excess mortality for Mongolia by calculating the average number of deaths (of all causes) per month in Mongolia and then comparing the numbers to January to June of 2020. If we see higher numbers than average, this is excess mortality. If roughly average or below average, we can determine that there was in fact no excess mortality. Data was collected from the National Statistics Office at 1212.mn 11. . # Import data from 1212.mn deaths = pd.read_csv(&#39;notebook_data/covid-19-risk/DT_NSO_2100_027V2_-_2020-08-03_-_www.1212.mn.csv&#39;, thousands=&#39;,&#39;) # Reformat dataframe to be in long form and drop extra column. deaths = deaths.melt(id_vars=[&#39;Aimag&#39;], var_name=&#39;date&#39;, value_name=&#39;deaths&#39;).drop(columns=[&#39;Aimag&#39;]) # View a sample of 5 rows of the dataframe. deaths.sample(5) . date deaths . 7 2016-08 | 1355 | . 33 2018-10 | 1461 | . 12 2017-01 | 1357 | . 31 2018-08 | 1391 | . 20 2017-09 | 1360 | . # Get the last two characters of the date column and save to a new column called month. deaths[&#39;month&#39;] = deaths[&#39;date&#39;].str[-2:] deaths.sample(5) . date deaths month . 49 2020-02 | 1298 | 02 | . 6 2016-07 | 1341 | 07 | . 23 2017-12 | 1411 | 12 | . 7 2016-08 | 1355 | 08 | . 20 2017-09 | 1360 | 09 | . # Calculate the average number of deaths for each month, excluding January to June 2020. deaths.iloc[0:48].groupby(by=&#39;month&#39;).mean() . deaths . month . 01 1433.25000 | . 02 1303.00000 | . 03 1436.00000 | . 04 1355.75000 | . 05 1435.75000 | . 06 1306.00000 | . 07 1390.75000 | . 08 1379.50000 | . 09 1371.50000 | . 10 1409.00000 | . 11 1316.75000 | . 12 1495.00000 | . Now that we have our average number of deaths per month, we can compare these to the death numbers for January to June 2020. . #collapse-hide fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(16,9)) ax.plot(np.arange(1,13), deaths.iloc[0:48].groupby(by=&#39;month&#39;).mean()[&#39;deaths&#39;], label=&#39;Historic Avg. 2016-2019&#39;) ax.plot(np.arange(1,7), deaths.iloc[48:][&#39;deaths&#39;], label=&#39;Reported Deaths&#39;) ax.set_xlabel(&#39;Month&#39;, fontsize=20) ax.set_ylabel(&#39;Deaths&#39;, fontsize=20) ax.legend() ax.set_title(&#39;Average Deaths Per Month vs Jan-Jun 2020&#39;, fontsize=28); . . It is clear that for January to June 2020 actual deaths were equal to or lower than historic averages. This means that we see no excess mortality. It is safe to say that there was no undiscovered outbreak of COVID-19 in Mongolia from January to June 2020. . Scenario 3 - An infected migrating bird flies in from China and infects nomads. . For our last scenario, let&#39;s assume that a migratory bird infected with COVID-19 infects a herder while he (let&#39;s also assume it is a he) is bring his cows home for the night. . Important: There is no evidence that bird to human transmission is possible. . We will create two models: . The herder decides to go to the Aimag center while he is infectious. Model the spread of the disease and the probability of being undiscovered. | The herder doesn&#39;t go anywhere, and only sees 2 people outside his immediate family each week. Model the spread of the disease. | Infection in aimag center . We will use the same methodology as Scenario 1. First we will model the spread of the disease with a SIR model and then check the probability of missed infections. Because this is still a city, we will use the same effective contact rate and recovery rate. . The primary difference here is the population. We will use a population of 12,000, as it is similar to the population of several aimag centers in Mongolia. . effective_contact_rate = 0.5 recovery_rate = 1/4 # Everyone not infected or recovered is susceptible total_pop = 12000 recovered = 0 infected = 1 susceptible = total_pop - infected - recovered # A list of days, 0-120 days = list(range(0, 120)) # We can calculate the R0 by dividing the effective contact rate by the recovery rate. print(&quot;R0 is&quot;, effective_contact_rate / recovery_rate) . R0 is 2.0 . # Use Scipy&#39;s differential equation method ret = odeint(deriv, [susceptible, infected, recovered], days, args=(total_pop, effective_contact_rate, recovery_rate)) S, I, R = ret.T # Build a dataframe of S, I, and R df_aimag = pd.DataFrame({ &#39;suseptible&#39;: S, &#39;infected&#39;: I, &#39;recovered&#39;: R, &#39;day&#39;: days }) # Look at days 0-10 df_aimag.head(11) . suseptible infected recovered day . 0 11999.00000 | 1.00000 | 0.00000 | 0 | . 1 11998.43202 | 1.28396 | 0.28402 | 1 | . 2 11997.70282 | 1.64850 | 0.64868 | 2 | . 3 11996.76665 | 2.11648 | 1.11687 | 3 | . 4 11995.56487 | 2.71718 | 1.71796 | 4 | . 5 11994.02220 | 3.48817 | 2.48962 | 5 | . 6 11992.04218 | 4.47761 | 3.48021 | 6 | . 7 11989.50111 | 5.74717 | 4.75172 | 7 | . 8 11986.24054 | 7.37580 | 6.38366 | 8 | . 9 11982.05761 | 9.46450 | 8.47789 | 9 | . 10 11976.69282 | 12.14228 | 11.16490 | 10 | . #collapse-hide fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(16,9)) ax.plot(df_aimag[&#39;day&#39;], df_aimag[&#39;infected&#39;]) ax.set_xlabel(&#39;Days&#39;, fontsize=20) ax.set_ylabel(&#39;Number Infected&#39;, fontsize=20) ax.set_title(&#39;SIR Model of COVID-19 Spread - Aimag Center of Pop 12,000&#39;, fontsize=26); . . #collapse-hide df_aimag[df_aimag[&#39;day&#39;] == 20] . . suseptible infected recovered day . 20 11714.47849 | 141.53496 | 143.98655 | 20 | . We see that the peak of infections in a smaller population occurs earlier (around 35 days). After 20 days there are 141 infections. Let&#39;s see how many are symptomatic and asymptomatic. . print(&quot;Asymptomatic cases: &quot;, 141 * .80) print(&quot;Sympomatic cases: &quot;, 141 * .20) . Asymptomatic cases: 112.80000000000001 Sympomatic cases: 28.200000000000003 . With 28 symptomatic cases, let&#39;s calculate the probability that they all would have a false negative test. . 0.01 ** 28 . 1.0000000000000006e-56 . Again we see an incredibly small probability. It is clear that any outbreak in a populated area like an aimag center would be identified relatively quickly. . Infection in a rural area . Now let&#39;s look at the SIR model in a rural area with a low population density. We use the following variables: . Effective contact rate - The issue with this number is that nomadic families have very occasional contact with those outside their immediate family. We will use a rate of .3 as a stand in for less contact. This means that the infected person has a 30% chance of infecting another person each day. | Recovery rate - This will stay at 4 days. | Population - We will assume a local population of 100 people. | . It is important to note that we have little data on the spread of COVID-19 in rural areas. Also, the SIR model does not factor in distance between the population. Nevertheless, let&#39;s go ahead with the model and see the results. . effective_contact_rate = 0.3 recovery_rate = 1/4 # Everyone not infected or recovered is susceptible total_pop = 100 recovered = 0 infected = 1 susceptible = total_pop - infected - recovered # A list of days, 0-120 days = list(range(0, 120)) # We can calculate the R0 by dividing the effective contact rate by the recovery rate. print(&quot;R0 is&quot;, effective_contact_rate / recovery_rate) . R0 is 1.2 . Our R0 is 1.2. Any R0 less than 1 means that the disease would not spread in the population and would die out. With an R0 of 1.2, we should expect a very slow spread. . # Use Scipy&#39;s differential equation method ret = odeint(deriv, [susceptible, infected, recovered], days, args=(total_pop, effective_contact_rate, recovery_rate)) S, I, R = ret.T # Build a dataframe of S, I, and R df_rural = pd.DataFrame({ &#39;suseptible&#39;: S, &#39;infected&#39;: I, &#39;recovered&#39;: R, &#39;day&#39;: days }) # Look at days 0-10 df_rural.head(11) . suseptible infected recovered day . 0 99.00000 | 1.00000 | 0.00000 | 0 | . 1 98.69642 | 1.04765 | 0.25593 | 1 | . 2 98.37953 | 1.09655 | 0.52393 | 2 | . 3 98.04909 | 1.14661 | 0.80430 | 3 | . 4 97.70492 | 1.19775 | 1.09732 | 4 | . 5 97.34689 | 1.24985 | 1.40326 | 5 | . 6 96.97488 | 1.30280 | 1.72232 | 6 | . 7 96.58885 | 1.35644 | 2.05471 | 7 | . 8 96.18879 | 1.41062 | 2.40059 | 8 | . 9 95.77476 | 1.46518 | 2.76006 | 9 | . 10 95.34687 | 1.51993 | 3.13319 | 10 | . #collapse-hide fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(16,9)) ax.plot(df_rural[&#39;day&#39;], df_rural[&#39;infected&#39;]) ax.set_xlabel(&#39;Days&#39;, fontsize=20) ax.set_ylabel(&#39;Number Infected&#39;, fontsize=20) ax.set_title(&#39;SIR Model of COVID-19 Spread - Rural Area with Population of 100&#39;, fontsize=26); . . We see that the virus would spread to 2 people and then effectively die out. While this model does not consider distance between the population, it is clear that with only occasional contact with the surrounding population the disease would not spread. In this case there is no cause for concern from an isolated rural infection. . Determining the Risk . My goal for this analysis is not to say that the risk of coronavirus in Mongolia is over. On the contrary, there are still infections being announced each week of those in quarantine arriving from abroad. In addition, some countries still have major challenges in curbing rising infections. . Instead, my goal was to assess the risk of community transmission over the past several months given what we know about quarantine and testing procedures in Mongolia. While this analysis is far from a comprehensive assessment of risk for the entire country, it does answer some of the most common questions I&#39;ve heard from Mongolians worried about coronavirus. A few examples: . All it takes is one infected person to cause a disaster. We have found that if one infected person was actually in public, we would almost surely have found out by now. | . | How do we know someone can&#39;t just sneak out of quarantine? If someone did sneak out of quarantine, we would very shortly see several people with symptoms at hospitals. These cases would very quickly discovered and contact tracing would rapidly occur. Just remember the figures, these cases would be quickly discovered. | . | Can you really trust that the government is doing its job? With regards to the quarantine, I believe the evidence I have given supports that the government is in fact doing its job. For other areas, I would defer to journalists. It is in their area of responsibility to question the government and inform the Mongolian people in this respect. | . | Better safe than sorry. There is risk in nearly anything we do. I&#39;ve shown that you are more likely to be struck by lightning several times in one year than for a cluster of COVID-19 infections to be missed. If this incredibly small risk is causing you to change your behavior, then you also may want to rethink walking outside in the rain. | . | . My hope is that this work and the work of others can start a discussion of how best to move forward given the times we are in. Staying closed off indefinitely is most surely a plan that will have very serious consequences. Yet exactly how restrictions should be relaxed and things reopened is a larger discussion for the Mongolian people and the government. . About the Author .

            "title": "Announcing Songolt.org",
            "content": "Hi, I&#39;m Robert Ritz, a Data Scientist and educator based in Mongolia. Welcome to Songolt.org, a place for datasets, analyses, and tools to support Mongolia&#39;s democracy and civil society. I built Songolt because I believe that data science has huge potential to support Mongolia and its citizens. In this post I want to explain my motivation for creating Songolt, what you can expect from this site going forward, and how you can expect this site to be transparent at all levels. . The Motivation . Situated between Russia and China, Mongolia is a shining light of democracy in a sea of authoritarianism after a peaceful democratic revolution in 1990. Rich in natural resources, it is the only country in Central Asia ranked Free by Freedom House. But Mongolia&#39;s democracy is still young, and its civil society is still being developed. Mongolia has no lack of challenges today and in the future. It faces economic challenges like increasing debt and fluctuating commodity prices that have caused boom and bust cycles in years past. Developmental challenges with regards to the disparity of living conditions between high-rise city dwellers, those living in poorly planned &quot;ger districts&quot;, and nomadic herders. Corruption remains an ever present reality. . Of course, these challenges are not unique to Mongolia. while not unique, these challenges are complex and, in todays information age, regularly involve lots of data. Civil society organizations, journalists, and concerned citizens usually do not have the technical resources or time to tackle many of these issues. With the rise of data science over the past several years, we now have tools and techniques that can help illuminate these challenges, and perhaps even propose solutions. . I&#39;ve been working in this area for some time in Mongolia. My first attempt was when I started Mongolian Data Stories, a Medium publication that uses data stories to provide insight into issues and challenges in Mongolia. I thought that by building inspiring data stories journalists and civil society would be able to follow along and produce their own unique data stories. Indeed, I found that there were many that wanted to create stories in this way, but there was often a skills gap or they simply did not have the time to devote to finding, cleaning, and analyzing the data behind these stories. . Songolt aims to be a bridge between the data and those who are charged with preserving and defending Mongolia&#39;s democracy, journalists and civil society organizations. Data science is uniquely suited to this type of work. Unlike traditional areas of science, data science does not solely live in academic journals or at universities. It lives all around us and must be able to be understood by all relevant stakeholders. . What to Expect . There will be three things you can expect to see on Songolt: . Datasets - Valuable data is often locked in a database, public facing government system, or scanned PDF documents. Often all that is needed is some data to get the conversation going. | Analyses - Issues like the current COVID-19 pandemic involve complex and ever changing data. The government rarely releases coherent analyses, instead relying on summary statistics with little context. Current, reliable analyses are sometimes needed to support a rational and fact based discussion. | Tools - Sometimes an issue will remain relevant over time or will be more complex than a static analysis can explain. In these situations a tool can often be the best way for journalists to discover insights in an unbiased way. | . By releasing difficult to obtain datasets, creating analyses of complex issues, and releasing tools that will allow self-service discovery of insights, I hope that this bridge will be enough to allow valuable discussions to occur. Initially there will be one to two posts a month, each being a dataset, analysis, or tool. . Each post will relate to a pressing need in Mongolia today. Occasionally related posts will be spaced out and comprise a larger project over time. For example I may release a dataset and then build a tool from it later. . Committment to Openness .

            "title": "Mongolian Electoral District Demographic Analysis",
            "content": "The current election saw a switch back to the block voting system used in 1992 and 2008. This system has both positives and negatives, and this system has much larger election districts than the previous single-member districts of the 2016 election. This allows us to more easily analyze the districts with the available data. . To put all of the data together and make it user friendly, I built election.songolt.org, an interactive data explorer that allows the reader to see key indicators of election districts. The indicators covered in the app include: . Population indicators: population, household size, herder percent, age group breakdown | Economic indicators (self-reported): salary, household loans, employment, education levels | Quality of life indicators: crime, house type, toilet &amp; water type, heating type The data was collected from 1212.mn and also the Household Socioeconomic Survey of 2016, which is the latest survey that contains precise geographic labeling. Both data sources are maintained by the National Statistics Office of Mongolia. | . Several themes developed through my research into this data. These themes are perhaps not surprising for many readers familiar with Mongolia, but it is never a bad thing to back up observations with data. I encourage you, the reader, to explore the app yourself (link), but below I give an overview of the themes for your convenience. . Ulaanbaatar vs Countryside . Perhaps the best-known difference in Mongolia is that of Ulaanbaatar and the countryside. The image of busy urban Ulaanbaatar juxtaposed with the bucolic countryside could hardly be more different. Indeed the data shows significant differences in many areas. Let’s compare the population pyramid for the election district with the highest population, Songinokhairkhan District in Ulaanbaatar, with the least populace, Bulgan Aimag. . . There is an obvious population difference, but the size of the age groups also shows a marked difference between the two. Where you have a large spike in the 20–40 age group in Songinokhairkhan, Bulgans’ age groups have much less variability and are quite flat from 15–50. You will see a similar trend in the highest population election districts compared with the least populated ones. . This means the voting demographics in rural areas are more widely distributed than in urban areas. D.Byambjav and E.Gerelt-Od previously discussed the large and less engaged block of voters under 35. If youth engagement initiatives are successful, this block of voters will be less powerful in rural districts that have a similar age distribution to Bulgan. . . Employment differs significantly as well between Ulaanbaatar and most rural districts. Rural election districts tend to show significantly higher rates of overall employment than the urban ones. In the chart above, the “employed percentage” refers to the proportion of the working-age population that is employed. Urban districts tend to have between 45–55% employment, with rural districts between 65–75%. . . Salaries are also significantly higher in Ulaanbaatar. The salaries shown above are self-reported from 2016, but they show a very clear picture. Employment levels may be higher in rural areas, but salary levels are conversely lower. This is an obvious area where the economic policy of the party platforms could address these inequalities. . Outliers: Mining Areas and Bayan-Ulgii . The Ulaanbaatar vs countryside theme may be the biggest theme in the data, it doesn’t give the full picture. There are two sets of outliers that “buck the trend”. . The first is that the two primary mining areas of Mongolia, Erdenet (in Orkhon) and Oyu Toloig (in Umnugovi), show significantly higher salaries, lower loan rates, and higher educations than other rural election districts. . . This bubble plot shows the percent of households with loans vs monthly average salaries in each election district. The two highlighted in red are Orkhon (lower right) and Umnugovi (upper left). All of the bubbles above 550k average monthly salary except for the two in red are located in Ulaanbaatar. . These two election districts (and the urban workforce where the company offices are) have benefited heavily from the mining industry of Mongolia. Industrialization as proposed in the party platforms would most likely further benefit these areas, as this is where the raw materials would come from. . . The second outlier is Bayan-Ulgii. In the chart above, the red bubble to the farthest left is Bayan-Ulgii, and the red bubble on the far right is Khan-Uul District. The average household size is 5.2, significantly larger than the most populace district Songinokhairkhan of 3.8. Besides larger family sizes, Bayan-Ulgii has the lowest average monthly salary. . Ulaanbaatar Districts Have Diverse Needs . The districts of Ulaanbaatar also show diverse needs. Every district also contains part of the ger district. This means that there is a mix of urban and peri-urban in every election district of Ulaanbaatar. In the center of the city, households are connected to the central water, heating, and sewage systems. In the ger district, living standards become sharply different, with no central heat or water connections. . . The unique layout of the city districts ensures that at least 20% of the population of each district uses pit toilets and wood or coal for heat. More than 40% of Khan-Uul district households, the most affluent election district in Mongolia, use ordinary wood and coal stoves for heat. . MPs Will Represent Very Diverse Groups . Regardless of the outcome of the election, it is clear that the needs of citizens in election districts are not uniform, and even the common trope of UB vs the rest doesn’t hold up completely. Even though Mongolia a small country with a heavy focus on mining, it isn’t clear that the party platforms address the inequalities mentioned above. . While the economics platforms of the DP, MPP, and Right Person Electorate all focus on heavy industry, it isn’t clear how heavy industry would help rural areas outside of the main mining areas lacking in high paying jobs, or whether it would increase employment levels in Ulaanbaatar. .",
