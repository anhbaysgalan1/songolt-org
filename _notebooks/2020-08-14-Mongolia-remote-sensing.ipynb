    "As the least densely populated soverign nation (2 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>), Mongolia has no lack of wide open spaces. Just a few kilometers outside the capital city, Ulaanbaatar, you will find vast expanses of steppe dotted with sheep, goats, cows, and the occasional horse herd. But this space also has a downside. \n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put, driving around Mongolia is hard. Mongolia's paved road network is mostly limited to connecting Ulaanbaatar with provincial capitals. Less than [25%](https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/linked-documents/48186-005-ssa.pdf) of Mongolia's road network is paved. This creates challenges for Mongolia's government, civil society organizations, and private businesses. Obtaining accurate information about activities outside the capital or province capitals is very hard to obtain. Remote sensing techniques are one way to mitigate this challenge. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Remote sensing](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-remote-sensing-and-what-it-used#:~:text=Remote%20sensing%20is%20the%20process,sense%22%20things%20about%20the%20Earth.), or the the process of detecting physical characteristics of an area by measuring reflected radiation, can obtain accurate information for a relatively low cost. Remote sensing can take the form of satellite images that look much like a Google Maps image, but images can also contain a lot of information in the non-visible spectrum that can be analyzed for various purposes. In addition, technologies like radar and LIDAR (light detection and ranging **or** light + radar) add to the types of information that can be obtained by satellites. Remote sensing is also not limited to satellites. Drones can be outfitted with similar types of sensors as satellites to gather information at a much finer detail. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remote sensing techniques can be used in one area over a period of time for a much lower cost than having a large team gather data on foot. To illustrate how this could be done in Mongolia, I will describe **five ways** remote sensing can be used to solve **real challenges** Mongolia faces. "

    "Mongolia has a long history of producing a limited range of vegetables, wheat, and other cereal crops. However, this domestic production does not always meet domestic demand, especially for wheat. With a short growing season, unpredictable rainfall, and large swings in temperature, Mongolia's agriculture sector faces many challenges with food crops. \n",
    "\n",
    "Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is one way to monitor crops cheaply and easily. By utilizing satellite imagery that is readily available, fields can be evaluated for the health of the crops over time. Here is an example of what an NDVI image looks like."

    "In the above image you can see the darker areas of the image, which would correspond to lower biomass. The higher the value on the scale, generally the healthier the plants. Farms can use this data to target problem spots and generally understand how their fields are producing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing satellite imagery and performing a weekly NDVI analysis on every farm in Mongolia during the growing season is reasonable and cost effective. Expecting small and medium farm enterprises to accomplish this task is not though. \n",
    "\n",
    "This type of analysis requires technical skills in both data engineering and IT infrastructure. Therefore a specialized program or office within the Ministry of Agriculture would be ideal. Given the national importance of meeting domestic demand of vegetables and cereals, it makes sense for the government to support farmers in this way."

    "If this change detection is combined with cadastral maps, construction permits, and mining permits, areas of illegal change could be more easily discovered."

Construction of the base of the railway was said to be completed, but without an official audit little is known about the current state of construction. Satellite imagery could be used to give a low cost initial assessment without the significant cost of an in person audit. \n",
